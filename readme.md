# JAVA Design Patterns

## Notes
1. The patterns are separated into packages e.g., `src.<pattern-name>_pattern`
1. The package name `without_pattern` is the use case scenario that do not use design pattern
1. The package name `with_pattern` is the use case scenario where design pattern is leveraged
1. All entry points are in `Main.java` file on each use case scenario's package
